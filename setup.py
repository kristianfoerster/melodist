long_description = """MELODIST is an open-source toolbox written in Python for
disaggregating daily meteorological time series to hourly time steps. The
software framework consists of disaggregation functions for each variable
including temperature, humidity, precipitation, shortwave radiation, and wind
speed. These functions can simply be called from a station object, which
includes all relevant information about site characteristics. The data
management of time series is handled using data frame objects as defined in the
pandas package. In this way, input and output data can be easily prepared and
processed."""
